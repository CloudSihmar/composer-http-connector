#Using the HTTP Operator in Google Cloud Composer

#Introduction
In this use case, we will demonstrate how to use the HTTP Operator in Google Cloud Composer (an implementation of Apache Airflow) to trigger an external HTTP endpoint. This can be particularly useful for integrating with external APIs, webhooks, or microservices as part of your data pipeline.

Prerequisites
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
Google Cloud Composer environment set up.
Access to an HTTP endpoint to trigger.
Steps
Create a New DAG: Create a new Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in your Composer environment.
Define the HTTP Operator: Use the SimpleHttpOperator to define the HTTP request.
Set Dependencies: Define the order of tasks in your DAG.
